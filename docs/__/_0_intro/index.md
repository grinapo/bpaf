#### Introduction and design goals
A quick intro. What, why and how

`bpaf` is a lightweight and flexible command line parser that uses both combinatoric and derive
style API

Combinatoric API usually means a bit more typing but no dependency on proc macros and more help
from the IDE, derive API uses proc macro to save on typing but your IDE will be less likely to
help you. Picking one API style does not lock you out from using the other style, you can mix
and match both in a single parser

# Design goals

## Parse, don't validate

`bpaf` tries hard to let you move as many invariants about the user input you are
trying to parse into rust types: for mutually exclusive options you can get `enum` with
exclusive items going into separate branches, and you can collect results into types like
[`BTreeSet`](std::collections::BTreeSet), or whatever custom type you might have with
custom parsing. Ideas for
[making invalid states unrepresentable](https://geeklaunch.io/blog/make-invalid-states-unrepresentable/)
and [using parsing over validation](https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/)
are not new.

That said you can also validate your inputs if this fits your situation better. If you want to
ensure that the sum of every numeric field must be divisible by both 3 and 5, but only when it's
Thursday - you can do that too.

## Flexibility

While aiming to be a general-purpose command line parser `bpaf` offers a few backdoors that
allow you to parse pretty much anything you want: chained commands, custom blocks of options,
DOS-style options (`/ofile.pas`), `dd` style options (`if=file of=out`), etc. A similar idea applies
to what the parser can produce - if your app operates with boxed string slices internally - `bpaf`
will give you `Box<str>` instead of `String` if you ask it to.

The only restriction is that you cannot use information from items parsed earlier (but not
the fact that something was parsed successfully or not) to decide to how to parse further
options, and even then you can side step this restriction by passing some shared state as a
parameter to the parsers.

## Reusability

Parsers in `bpaf` are not monolithic and you can share their parts across multiple binaries,
workspace members or even independent projects. Say you have multiple binaries in a workspace
that perform different operations on some input. You can declare a parser for the input
specifically, along with all the validations, help messages or shell dynamic completion
functions you need and use it across all the binaries alongside the arguments specific to
those binaries.

## Composition, transformation

Parsers in `bpaf` are not finalized either, say you have a parser that describes a single input
for your program, it can take multiple arguments or perform extra validations, etc. You can
always compose this parser with any other parser to produce tuples of both results for example.
Or to make it so parser runs multiple times and collects results into a `Vec`.

## Performance

While performance is an explicit non-goal - `bpaf` does nothing that would pessimize it either,
so performance is on par or better compared to other fully featured parsers.

## Correctness

`bpaf` would parse only items it can represent and will reject anything it cannot represent
in the output. Say your parser accepts both `--intel` and `--att` flags, but encodes the result
into `enum Style { Intel, Att }`, `bpaf` will accept those flags separately, but not if they
are used both at once. If the parser later collects multiple styles into a `Vec<Style>` then it
will accept any combinationof those flags.

## User friendly

`bpaf` tries to provide user-friendly error messages, and suggestions for typos but also scripts
for shell completion, `man` pages and markdown documentation for the web.
